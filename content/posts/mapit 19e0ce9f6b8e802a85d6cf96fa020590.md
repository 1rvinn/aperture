# mapit

the idea: the user should be able to input pdf(s) which get converted into mindmaps for easy learning. the same should be done for github repos. in addition, there should be an llm to ask questions.

useful for neurodiverse people; facilitates better learning for them

inspirations

- 1. docagram
    
    creates flow-chart summaries from web pages
    
    flow:
    
    ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image.png)
    
    - takes in data from web page sections
    - creates a summary of each of those sections
    - generates relationships between parts of the section
    - has 2 versions -
        - w/o gemini: uses summarizer api and prompt api for the 2 tasks respectively
        - w/ gemini
    
    example:
    
    - content:
        
        ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image%201.png)
        
    - summary:
        
        ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image%202.png)
        
    - summary v2 (used to generate the graph)
        
        ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image%203.png)
        
    - graph/mermaid diagram:
        
        ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image%204.png)
        
        a shaded box displays the relationship, the unfilled boxes are entities
        
    - gemini result
        
        ![image.png](mapit%2019e0ce9f6b8e802a85d6cf96fa020590/image%205.png)
        
    - also have the ability to display all graphs together, can choose specific entitites to show as well if someone wants to learn topic wise
- 2. https://medium.com/@elle.neal_71064/mind-mapping-with-ai-an-accessible-approach-for-neurodiverse-learners-1a74767359ff

initial plan looks like this (19/02/25):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
	A[document]--->|segmentor|B[segments of data]--->|summarizer|D[summarized segments of data]--->|relationship determiner|E[mermaid diagram]
	A--->C[rag]--->F[llm]
	D--->E
```

// want to create it on streamlit since minimal ui, simpler coding

// can deploy on streamlit or vercel (vercel will look more professional)

update 1 (19/2/25):

- i feel like i should pivot this towards github. a tool that facilitates understanding of complex repos through mindmap generation and llm integration
    - for github repo, i need to parse the contents into an llm acceptable format. there are tools doing that already. i am not sure whether to use them/their apis or develop it completely on my own.
    - one of the ideas i came across recently was that of [https://www.entelligence.ai/explore](https://www.entelligence.ai/explore) - they take in repos, integrate an llm, provide documentation and flow diagram.
        - the llm responses are really good - looks finetuned (??)
- maybe have both options - github and documents
    - multimodal support is crucial - it should be able to take in documents, pictures,

the road

- 1. trying out beautiful soup (referring to https://medium.com/@elle.neal_71064/mind-mapping-with-ai-an-accessible-approach-for-neurodiverse-learners-1a74767359ff)
    
    ```bash
    pip install bs4 requests
    // created a venv called mapit
    did pip install bs4 requests again
    ```
    
    python code:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    
    def scrape_text(url):
        # Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)
    
        # If the GET request is successful, the status code will be 200
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Get the content of the response
            page_content = response.content
    
            # Create a BeautifulSoup object and specify the parser
            soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, "html.parser")
    
            # Get the text of the soup object
            text = soup.get_text()
    
            # Return the text
            return text
        else:
            return "Failed to scrape the website"
    
    url=input("enter url:")
    text=scrape_text(url)
    print(text)
    ```
    
    returns text in the website.
    
- 2. implementing this medium article: https://medium.com/@elle.neal_71064/mind-mapping-with-ai-an-accessible-approach-for-neurodiverse-learners-1a74767359ff
    - they’ve given the entire *input_text* received after parsing to the model and asked to generate mermaid maps
    - i want mine to be better - it should generate summaries and mermaids for each section, determine the relation among the sections and generate a cohesive mermaid also
- 3. trying to get mermaid diags via chatgpt
    - asked chatgpt to analyse my repo - via the repo link - and asked to give a mermaid code explaining it
    - output:
        
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[Start] --> B[Load Configuration]
            B --> C[Read Input Data: Orders & Locations]
            C --> D[Fetch Route Data from APIs]
            D --> E[Optimize Routes using Held-Karp Algorithm]
            E --> F[Calculate Emissions Based on Route]
            F --> G[Generate Optimized Route and Emissions Report]
            G --> H[Display Output to User]
            H --> I[End]
            
            %% Dependencies
            D -->|API Calls| J{TomTom API / HERE API}
            J --> D
        ```
        
        the output aint bad
        
    - then i used [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/) to get llm ready parseed version of my repo. gave it as context to gpt4o and asked it to give a mermaid code.
        
        prompt: [llm ready parsed info (token length - 4.7k)] given the above description of a repository, write code for a mermaid diagram explaining the same
        
        - output:
            
            ```mermaid

            ```
            
        - maybe ask it to give 2 separate diagrams for directory structure and code logic.
            
            prompt: give 2 separate codes - one explaining the directory structure and the other explaining the code, logic and flow
            
            output:
            
            - og output: has errors

            - the outputs were sub standard despite using a sota model - 4o which has a big context window.
            - when i use an api, the output’s quality is bound to degrade.
            - the token size is also something that should be taken care of; some repos are excessively big and hence really big token sizes which would be hard to handle.
            - therefore, it is of utmost importance to divide the content into sections, provide summaries for each part and then ask the model to create a diagram.
                - testing this hypothesis
            - also, what about rag? - cant use it for

- 4. code to get llm ready parsed github data
    - using requests and base 64, got the following code running that prints the contents of a github repo given its name and the owner’s name. uses github api for it.

    ^ need to make the following changes:
    
    - [x]  need to change this to take in a url
        
        must have ‘https://github.com/’ in the beginning - a possible scope of error
        
    - [x]  currently, it’s also printing image and hidden files/directories’ data, which it should skip
        
        ^ excluded the following extensions:
        
        .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .svg, .ico, .webp, .pdf, .zip, .tar, .gz, .mp4, .mp3, .avi
        
    - [x]  need it to also print the structure on top
    - [x]  must also print that it has exited a directory
    - issue: github api has a limited no. of requests (60) per hour per ip.
        - one request is used per file/directory accessed
        - how to bypass this!!!!!!!
        - update 10/3/25: lol i just had to pass my github auth token and the no of requests per hour increases from 60 to 5000
    
- divide it into sections (or files); llm provides a technical summary of each section (or file); then these summaries and the structure is fed into the system to analyse the contents and give a mermaid diagram
- can we integrate rag so that it’s able to refer to specifics within the code for a more detailed diagram.
    
    ^ dont really think this is required, since the mermaid diagram is only aimed at providing a high level summary of how the entire code works.
    
- can have mermaid diagrams per section (or file), then one combining them too
- this kind of ui looks really good. plus if the creation could be animated then would look very cool.

        - thoughts:
            - i think these final prompts are good.
- combined thing
    - iter1:
        - made a streamlit front end
        - takes in pdfs
        - checks whether an image based pdf or text based
        - uses easyocr and pypdf2 for image and text based pdfs respectively
        - extracted text given to segmentor and summarizer
        - gives topics and summaries, displayed there
        - passed to relationship generator. generates relationships within each thing. prints them
        - one combined relationship generator. topic wise summaries given together, gives the relationships and prints the mermaid diagram
        
        // problems:
        
        - shows syntax error many times
        
        // now need to change it to give the content to relationship generator
        
    - iter2: content goes to the relationship generator. the topics are decided on the basis of major topics
    - iter3: segments on the basis of titles, gives content to both rel and summarizer
        - change summarize prompt
        - 
    - iter4: segments on its own, gives content to both rel and summarizer
    
    there are 4 options available
    
    1. segment and summarize together, ie the model decides the main topics. send topic wise summaries to relationship maker
    2. segment on the basis of titles, and then summarize, ie the topics are decided on the basis of how they’re presented in the doc then send topic wise summaries
    3. segment on the basis of titles, send content to summarizer to display summaries. relationship maker also gets content.
    4. segment according to what it thinks the major topics are, then send content to summarizer and relationship maker.
        
        
        |  | content to rel | no content to rel |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | titles | iter3 | iter2 |
        | own | iter4 | iter1 |
    
    benefits of extracting titles on its own are that big files get segregated into small topics that are easy to understand.
    
    - failed to generate topics error cuz “s, \escape in json, expecting delimiter etc
        - either remove these problem creating elements or donot extract content.
    
    because of the reason listed above, we get rid of iter3, 4. 
    
    now in iter2, 1, i think it is more relevant if we do it file wise for github repos and otherwise for other pdfs.
    
    iter 1 final
    
    - added the functionality to take in github repos
    - changed the prompts to be different for pdfs and repos
    - need to make the following fixes:
        - syntax error
        - mindmaps not viewable nicely
        - ui/ux changes
    
    [17/3/25]
    
    integrated mistral’s ocr
    
    - omg it looks so good, i changed text based pdfs to also go through mistrals ocr
    
    cleaned the code, divided into various files and enabled the functions to be imported from there
    
    - ~~need to make ui changes~~
    - ~~need to create .env~~
    - ~~run the prompts through chatgpt and get better ones~~
    - ~~need to structure json~~
    - ~~need to integrate caching~~
    
    [18/3/25]
    
    - the mermaid diagrams arent being represented nicely, they’re usually being cut off at the bottom unless i make the container size atypically large, which makes it very out of place.
        - tried numerous work arounds, nothing seemed to work
        - then randomly came across a python library that helps to display mermaid code in streamlit and it worked like a charm
    - trying to get better prompts
        - explained the pipeline to chatgpt, gave current prompts and asked it to generate newer and more precise ones
    - ~~need to improve the colour scheme~~
    - made prompt changes, ui changes, looks really cool. just need to integrate rag now.
